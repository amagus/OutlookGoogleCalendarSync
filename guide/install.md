## Release Types

Because the software is open source and has no formal support, OGCS is released as alphas and betas to indicate it might not be as polished a product as one that is being sold and has telephone support! __However__, having been available for several years and constantly being improved, it _is_ a stable product - the naming is now simply more to do with the frequency of releases.

### Alpha
The most recent version of the applicaton, with more regular updates than the beta. If you want to see the latest functionality, or see if a possible bug has already been fixed, you should use the alpha release.

### Beta
After several alphas have been released, the new features and improvements will be "rolled up" into a new beta release. If you don't need new features and prefer to work on an application that doesn't require frequent updates, then the beta is probably for you.

## Application Versions

Both release types of the software can either be installed or run as a "portable" application. The installed version will suffice for the majority of people. 

In terms of functionality, both versions are the same, but here's a quick comparison:


|  | Installed | Portable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Set Up | Download the `OGCS_Setup.exe` file, double-click it to execute, and OGCS will start. | Download the `Portable ZIP` file and then extract the compressed files to a location of your choosing. Double-click the `OutlookGoogleCalendarSync.exe` executable file to start OGCS. |
| Application Location | The local `APPDATA` folder for the user. | Anywhere, possibly a USB drive. |
| Upgrading OGCS | Simply accept the upgrade prompt when a newer version is detected. | The newer ZIP file will need manually downloading, either to replace the existing location of OGCS, or a new location. |
| OS Permissions Required | None. | None. |
| Multiple versions | Only one version at a time. | Each extracted application is standalone, so multiple versions is fine. You may want this to experiment with different releases of OGCS. |
| Multiple Google accounts | Only one. | Settings are specific to each extract of OGCS, by default. Further [details in the wiki](https://github.com/phw198/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync/wiki/Running-Multiple-Instances-of-OGCS). |
| Sync multiple calendars | From v2.9.3 | From v2.9.3. Or configure a single calendar for [each deployment](https://github.com/phw198/OutlookGoogleCalendarSync/wiki/Running-Multiple-Instances-of-OGCS) of an earlier release. |
