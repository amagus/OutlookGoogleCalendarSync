# Sync Options

This is where you configure **[how](syncoptions-how), [when](syncoptions-when)** and **[what](syncoptions-what)** is synced between your calendars.

Changes to any of the settings will take immediate effect for the next synchronisation of calendars, but they won't persist between restarting OGCS unless the `Save` button is clicked.  
By clicking the down arrow next to the `Save` button, settings can also be **exported** as a backup, as well as **imported** between OGCS instances or installations.
